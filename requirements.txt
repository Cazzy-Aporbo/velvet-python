# Velvet Python - Production Dependencies
# ========================================
# Author: Cazzy Aporbo, MS
# Created: January 2025
#
# These are the core dependencies needed to run Velvet Python.
# I keep this minimal - only what's absolutely necessary for production.
# Development dependencies go in requirements-dev.txt
#
# To install: pip install -r requirements.txt
# To upgrade: pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Core Dependencies
# -----------------
# These are the absolute essentials for the project to run

# Rich - Beautiful terminal output (our pastel theme needs this)

# Pydantic - Data validation (ensures our configs are correct)
pydantic==2.5.3

# Python-dotenv - Environment variable management (.env files)
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Click - Typer dependency, but specifying for version control
click==8.1.7

# Web Application Dependencies
# ----------------------------
# For the interactive dashboards in each module

# Streamlit - Interactive web apps (for our beautiful dashboards)
streamlit==1.29.0

# Plotly - Interactive visualizations
plotly==5.18.0

# Data Processing
# ---------------
# Essential data handling libraries

# Pandas - Data manipulation (used in multiple modules)

# NumPy - Numerical computing (Pandas dependency, but being explicit)
numpy==1.26.3

# Utility Libraries
# -----------------
# Common utilities used across modules

# PyYAML - YAML file parsing
pyyaml==6.0.1

# toml - TOML file parsing (for pyproject.toml)
toml==0.10.2

# Requests - HTTP library (for API modules)
requests==2.31.0

# Packaging - Version handling and requirements parsing
packaging==23.2

# Module-Specific Core Dependencies
# ----------------------------------
# These are needed by specific modules but common enough to include

# Pipdeptree - Dependency tree visualization (01-environments)
pipdeptree==2.13.1

# Psutil - System and process utilities

# Platform Support
# -----------------
# Cross-platform compatibility

# Colorama - Colored terminal output on Windows
colorama==0.4.6 ; platform_system=='Windows'

# Version Constraints
# -------------------
# Python version requirement
# Requires-Python: >=3.10

# Notes
# -----
# I keep this file minimal on purpose. Each module has its own
# requirements.txt for module-specific dependencies. This file
# only contains what's needed to run the core framework.
#
# For development dependencies (testing, linting, etc.), 
# see requirements-dev.txt
#
# To install everything for development:
# pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
