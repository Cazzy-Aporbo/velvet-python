Misdiagnosed Health Conditions Data Collection Script

This script demonstrates the methodology used to collect data on commonly misdiagnosed 
health conditions across different demographics. It shows how to:
1. Search for relevant medical research and articles
2. Extract condition information from medical websites
3. Collect research evidence and citations
4. Structure the data into a comprehensive CSV dataset
