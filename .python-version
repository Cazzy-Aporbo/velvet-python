# Why .python-version exists
# ==========================
# Author: Cazzy Aporbo, MS
# 
# This file tells pyenv which Python version to use for this project.
# When you enter the project directory, pyenv automatically switches
# to this Python version.
#
# I chose Python 3.11.7 because:
# - It's stable and well-tested
# - Has all the modern features we need
# - Great performance improvements over 3.10
# - Compatible with all our dependencies
#
# How it works:
# 1. Install pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
# 2. Install this Python version: pyenv install 3.11.7
# 3. When you cd into this directory, pyenv activates 3.11.7
#
# You can also set it manually:
# pyenv local 3.11.7  (creates/updates this file)
# pyenv global 3.11.7 (sets system-wide default)
#
# To check current version:
# python --version
#
# If you don't use pyenv, you can ignore this file.
# Just make sure you're using Python 3.10+ for compatibility.
